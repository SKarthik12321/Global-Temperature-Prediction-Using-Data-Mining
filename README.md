# Predicting Global Temperature Trends Using Data Mining Techniques in Orange

## 🌎 Overview
This project focuses on predicting global temperature trends using data mining techniques applied through the Orange data mining tool. By analyzing historical climate datasets, we explore different machine learning algorithms to predict and visualize temperature changes across various global regions.

## 🛠 Tools and Technologies
- **Orange Data Mining Tool**
- **Data Mining and Machine Learning Algorithms**
- **Climate Dataset (Historical Data)**

## 📊 Algorithms and Models Used
- **Random Forest** — for robust prediction and feature importance evaluation
- **k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN)** — for classification-based prediction
- **k-Means Clustering** — for unsupervised clustering of climate data
- **DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise)** — for identifying anomalies and dense climate patterns
- **PCA (Principal Component Analysis)** — for dimensionality reduction and better visualization

## ⚙️ Workflow
1. Load the historical climate dataset.
2. Select and preprocess relevant features.
3. Apply dimensionality reduction using PCA.
4. Train predictive models (Random Forest, kNN).
5. Perform clustering analysis (k-Means, DBSCAN).
6. Evaluate model performance using tools like Confusion Matrix, ROC Curves, and Silhouette Scores.
7. Visualize results through Heat Maps, Scatter Plots, and other interactive plots.

## 🎯 Goals
- Predict future temperature trends based on historical data.
- Identify hidden patterns and groupings in climate data.
- Evaluate and compare the effectiveness of different machine learning models.
- Visualize complex climate patterns in a simple, interactive way.
